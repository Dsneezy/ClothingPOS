# ClothingPOS
I worked in a group of 3 people to create a software system report for a hypothetical Clothing Point of Sales sytem.

The final document is organized by me and I added a few sections of my own after we finished working on it as a group.

This document adds as an example of what a system report document would look like after gathering software specifications from a client and providing the outline of how the system would be created.
